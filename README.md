This project focuses on building an image classification model using the CIFAR-10 dataset, a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 object categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, and more. The dataset was downloaded via Kaggle and extracted, with image data and labels preprocessed for model training. We started by building a simple neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to establish a baseline for classification accuracy.

To significantly improve the performance, we leveraged the power of transfer learning by incorporating the ResNet50 architecture pretrained on ImageNet. Since CIFAR-10 images are originally 32x32 pixels, they were upsampled to 256x256 to match the input size expected by ResNet50. We then appended custom dense layers to adapt the model to our specific classification task, followed by training and evaluation phases that showcased noticeable improvements in accuracy over the basic neural network model.

This repository includes data preprocessing scripts, model building and training code, and evaluation results with training plots. The project demonstrates how pretrained convolutional neural networks can be fine-tuned for smaller image classification tasks and serves as a practical example of deep learning applied to computer vision challenges.
